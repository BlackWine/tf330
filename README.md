If you have poor soldering skills and feel the need to mock me for not using through hole technology please dont bother. I've heard it all before and I will just laugh at you. Through hole sucks. 

Also do not ask me to reroute the board to a different DRC so you can use your local boardhouse. I dont feel like spending 100 hours of my time to save you $10. The DRC on this board is 7-7-7 and any boardhouse that doesnt totally suck can do this. Also it 4 layer and dont ask if i can be made 2 layer. The answer is no. 

If you need help with this the best place to get it is the exxos forum https://www.exxoshost.co.uk/forum/ 

Please do not message me directly. Start a thread. 

I do my best to help people who ask polite questions in public but if you make your inadequecies my problem them you are on your own.

I dont care if you think my HDL is not pristine either. It works perfecly fine for what its intended to be. This is not an exercise in German over engineering. Its just a simple repeatable board that works and there are about 500 of them built and working reliably.

I dont like forks because i dont like options. Options mean more testing and more testing = time. So if you fork you are on your own but if you fork and dont give credit I will make it my mission in life to punish you. I will summon the ancient spirits of evil like Jack Tramiel and have them haunt you for all time. You have been warned.
